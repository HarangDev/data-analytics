# Sliding Windows Algorithm

1. train a image classifier.
2. Put a 'window' on an image and run that part of the image through trained classifier. Slide the window and do it again.
3. Increase the window size and repeat 2.

# Computational Cost

This algorithm is computationally expensive, since you need to run your classifier many many times.

If you increase the stride, or try few window sizes, computational cost will decrease but its performance will decrease too.
