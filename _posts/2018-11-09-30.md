Landmark detection is basically the same as object localization. The only difference is that it outputs points, rather than area.

Let's say you want to find out important points in human face (corners of the mouth and tip of the chin). What you have to do is train a CNN with output that is composed of x and y coordinates of these important points.

The output of one image will be a vector composed of 7 elements;
1. 1 if it is a face and 0 if it isn't
2. x-coordinate of the left corner of the mouth
3. y-coordinate of the left corner of the mouth
4. x-coordinate of the right corner of the mouth
5. y-coordinate of the right corner of the mouth
6. x-coordinate of the tip of the chin
7. y-coordinate of the tip of the chin
