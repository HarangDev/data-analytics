At time $t$ , how do we select the best bandit machine? We can take mean of rewards we've got from each machine and choose the machine with the highest mean.

$$
\bar{R}_t = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{i=1}^{t}R_i
$$

where $R_i$ is the reward we got from a particular machine at time $i$ and $\bar{R}_t$ is the mean of rewards we've got from a particular machine until time $t$ .

However, this method of computing mean is inefficient since we need to keep track of all $R_i$ s.

Actually, new mean can be calculated from old mean;

$$
\bar{R}_t = (1-\frac{1}{t})\bar{R}_{t-1}+\frac{1}{t}R_t
$$

This is much more memory efficient, so we choose this method when computing mean.
